Musik Magazine der Stadt Leipzig

## Objectives

.) Serve as a platform to connect musicians and audience in a multicultural, diverse and musically rich city, with more underground than awareness, with more production and potential audience than actual audience

.) This project will be used as a project for SPA and maybe BE parts of the DCI-Course

.) In this regard it must:
    .) be a testing ground
    .) a path to learn and digest:
            .) some technologies
            .) learn more about wireframes, design patterns and JS animations
            .) learn more about project pitching and presentation
    .) as well to put them together (React + SCSS + BEM + Atomic Design { in the form of the SCSS-WIP library } JSON-Server)
    .) refine design from an UI / UX perspective, with special care for accessibility and design criteria (from carbon or material design)
