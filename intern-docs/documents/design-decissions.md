# DESIGN DECISSIONS

It must be very appealing, bold, impact, punk

## COLOR

{ main color : orange?? }
 
We can articulate the design not around one color, but around one typography.
Every page would have a different color.
It's a risky decission, but it's a very dynamic one as well.

## TYPOGRAPHY

Sans Seriff
Big, Bold
{ It can be SO BIG that actually is a window } veeery risky decission
Inspiration on Mode Magazine

## ANIMATION

Scroll animations
Interaction with the web
Wochentrack will not be a page, but a component that gives you the option to play music (sound bar animation) + a btn for info about the band / soloist
