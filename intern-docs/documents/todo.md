// PROBLEMS

    text-block in Single Article / HistorySingleArticle / Impressum zu breit

    blob in header must be different (work with different border radius)

    wie so funktioniert z-index in Footer nicht?

    how to make a calendar (=> events)?

    structure for the "Single Article / History Single Article" Component

    structure for the "Articles / History Articles" Component

// QUESTIONS

    how do you add more fields for musicians with the same attributes (fname, lname, instrument) wo knowing in beforehand how many musicians are there? (same problem is for social media: one doesn't know how many and which social media do they have)
    
    other problem is : the three fields must be linked by an id. Can you provide multiple id to a single element?
    
    There must be the option to link an already existing musician's profile to the band

    do "pestañas"

    do calendar (look <Events />)

    wie so ist "font-size" im Impressum 2.4+rem?

    ein Form - Component, oder 3 Components (ein für jede Variante)?


// TASKS


    // links between pages (beware buttons!!)

    // to publish an event you must to log in somehow

    // it would be nice to provide the web the hability to match a musician, so the veranstalter can find them easy, in case this musician has a profile
