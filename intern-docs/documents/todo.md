            why is body in events overflowing?
            event bg-img defined as style? or how?

    css conflict between header and footer { on different sizes }

    footer - burger not showing content


    { STRUCTURE }


    implement useFetch in:

        Community (Musician- Bands- & OtherTab)


    history-single-article NOT DISPLAYING

    tabs not working properly ( only "other" )



// REFINE

    box-shadow as a scss variable
    go-to-top button
    landing page article-preview button width
    landing page community-previe button width (768)
    single-article => button "more articles" and "next article"
    contact { .contact-option arrow => align}
    team images different mask ?
    community / img addapt to info (or limit info)
    wrap links around buttons (instead of buttons around links) and style accordingly
    load article
    better burger menu & footer burger menu

    PRE: to have a BE
        * We need a system to pick max (3?) links / icons (the user can mark which options are the main links, and they'll store a "important" key with the value "true" in the links)

        * {"tw" : ["@handle", true]}

        * When you send your contact info, you get the option to log as musician / veranstalter, which brings you into the "musician" or "veranstalter" page, which again must take your info (from the previous contact form)

        
        * links between musicians / bands / events / veranstalter / venues (places) { it would be nice to provide the web the hability to match a musician, so the veranstalter can find them easy, in case this musician has a profile }  ==>> [ musicians + bands + veranstalter + venues must be linked by an id. Can you provide multiple id to a single element? => solution: write a function that evaluates => if(this I has a value [X, Y, Z]) { print this value into an p or li }. ] => for that you need a single page for every musician, band, other and concert
