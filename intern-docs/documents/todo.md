// questions

    how do you add more fields for musicians with the same attributes (fname, lname, instrument) wo knowing in beforehand how many musicians are there? (same problem is for social media: one doesn't know how many and which social media do they have)
    
    other problem is : the three fields must be linked by an id. Can you provide multiple id to a single element?
    
    There must be the option to link an already existing musician's profile to the band

// it would be nice to provide the web the hability to match a musician, so the veranstalter can find them easy, in case this musician has a profile
